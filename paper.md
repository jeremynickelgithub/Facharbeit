# 1. Introduction

# 2. Main Part
Reconnaissance Energy Africa (ReconAfrica), a Canadian junior oil and gas company started exploratory oil drillings on January 11th, 2021 in the Okavango region in Namibia, which is a north-western area around the Okavango river. It is home to many endangered animals and the only conjunct area in Namibia that can be used for agricultural development because it has the highest rainfall in Namibia, which is mostly a desert state. Therefore, it is highly important to protect the ecosystem against oil related destruction of nature such as in the Niger-Delta, Nigeria. 
Not only did I choose this topic because it is a very recent one, which can still be influenced upon but also because it is a prime example for a conflict that is not exclusive to a distant African country but one that happens all around the globe and is a fundamental question in economy:
What do we preserve? The economic growth that comes from the exploitation of our natural resources, or the fragile nature on our planet to secure habitability for future generations   
In this essay I will discuss if a compromise between the conservation of the Okavango region and economic growth through the export of oil are an achievable goal. I will also discuss which measures must be taken to prevent the destruction of ecosystems in Nigeria by avoiding the mistakes that were made by the Nigerian government and the big oil companies in the Niger-Delta.  

Since Nigeria gained its independence in 1960 from Britain, the country has been hit by many socio-ecological setbacks such as military coups, civil wars and ethnic conflicts. While not all these problems arise from Nigeria´s oil-rich geographical conditions, a lot of issues regarding the unjust distribution of wealth, high rate in criminal- and terrorist activities and corruption can be traced back to the extraction of crude oil and its impacts on Nigeria.

# 2.1 The Origin of Nigeria´s dependency on oil extraction 
When crude oil in the Niger-Delta was first discovered in 1958 it quickly became Nigeria´s most important form of government revenue. Its impact on all sectors of the economy only expanded when the prices of crude oil skyrocketed in 1973 by 158% and in 1979 by 118% again. After the second economic boom, Nigeria “evolved from a poor agricultural economy into a relatively rich, oil-dominated one” (Economic crossroads: The experiences of Nigeria and lessons from Malaysia). The export revenue of oil accounted for 96% of all exports and 30% of Nigeria´s GDP in 1980. 
“Dutch Disease” is a term that perfectly describes this form of inorganic increase in government revenue. This mostly happens when a country has a predominant economic sector that experiences an explosive growth because of an increase in global demand. This economic model was first described in the weekly newspaper The Economist in 1977. It analysed how the discovery of 2.8trn cubic meters of natural gas overvalued the Dutch currency and thereby harmed the Dutch economy.
Because of the economic growth correlated to the oil, the Nigerian government stopped investments in the agricultural sector, which employed more than 60% of Nigeria´s total labour force in order to allocate more jobs into the high paying oil sector. With this reform of the economy came Nigeria´s dependency on the export of crude oil and its volatility on the unpredictable price of oil.
# 2.2 The negative effects of the “Dutch Disease”
As Zuzana Brinčíková states in her article “The Dutch Disease: An Overview”, published in 2016 by the European Scientific Journal, the effects of the “Dutch-Disease” differ relative to the exchange rate mechanism of a country. The rate of exchange Nigeria used until 1986 was a fixed one, meaning that the Nigerian Naira was based on the international price of gold. This meant that with a rise in the price of gold came an upswing in the value of the Nigerian currency and vice-versa. Brinčíková writes that in fixed exchange systems “large inflows of foreign currency will increase the money supply and domestic prices”. This results in an economic domino effect, causing the traditional exports to become more and more expensive for other countries to buy because of the higher monetary supply. Another effect of the Dutch Disease is the reduction of its secondary economic sector. This happens because foreign produced goods remain at a low price while products that were manufactured in the “infected country” become more expensive to pay for the higher wages. This gives imported products an advantage over home made ones, causing the secondary sector of its own economy to cripple. In 1975 Nigeria´s secondary sector was only responsible for 10.4% of its annual GDP, whereas its primary sector, that includes the extraction of raw materials made up 68.9% of Nigeria´s GDP. The dependency on the oil sector that comes with the decline of alternative forms of revenue caused the Nigerian government to spiral out of control trying to generate revenue to build infrastructure and other long-term investments by locating more workforce to foreign oil companies like Shell, which in return only made the country more dependent on petroleum exports and the interest of oil companies.
