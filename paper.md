# 1. Introduction

# 2. Main Part

Since Nigeria gained its independence in 1960 from Britain, the country has been hit by many socio-ecological setbacks such as military coups, civil wars and ethnic conflicts. While not all these problems arise from NigeriaÂ´s oil-rich geographical conditions, a lot of issues regarding the unjust distribution of wealth, rise in criminal- and terrorist activities and devaluation of the Nigerian currency can be traced back to the extraction of crude oil and its impacts in Nigeria.
