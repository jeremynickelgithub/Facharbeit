# 1. Introduction
Reconnaissance Energy Africa (ReconAfrica), a Canadian junior oil and gas company started exploratory oil drillings on January 11th, 2021 in the Kavango region in Namibia, which is a protected area, near the Okavango river (see: Barbee 2021). It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, which makes it highly important to protect the ecosystem against oil related destruction of nature such as in the Niger-Delta, Nigeria. 
Not only did I choose this topic because it is a very recent one, which can still be influenced upon but also because it is a prime example for a conflict that is not exclusive to a distant African country but one that happens all around the globe and is a fundamental question in economy:
What do we preserve? The economic growth that comes from the exploitation of our natural resources, or the fragile nature on our planet to secure habitability for future generations.   
In this essay I will discuss which measures must be taken to prevent the destruction of ecosystems in Namibia and how a potential oil boom would influence the Namibian economy. I will do this by first discussing what mistakes were made during and after the oil boom in Nigeria in the 1970s and what differences exist between the Namibian and Nigerian economy. After that, I will discuss if crude oil can be a non-destructive addition to an economy and how this can be achieved

# 2.1 The Origin of Nigeria´s dependency on oil extraction 
Since Nigeria gained its independence in 1960 from Britain, the country has been hit by many socio-ecological setbacks such as military coups	, civil wars, and ethnic conflicts (see: Ikenwa 2019). While not all these problems arise from Nigeria´s oil-rich geographical conditions, a lot of issues regarding the unjust distribution of wealth, high rate in criminal- and terrorist activities and corruption can be traced back to the extraction of crude oil and its impacts on Nigeria (see: Onyinye 2015, p.313). 
When crude oil in the Niger-Delta was first discovered in 1958 it quickly became Nigeria´s most important form of government revenue. Its impact on all sectors of the economy only expanded when the prices of crude oil quickly grew in 1973 by 158% and in 1979 by 118% again. After the second economic boom, Nigeria “evolved from a poor agricultural economy into a relatively rich, oil-dominated one” (Baharuddin 2011, p.1). The export revenue of oil accounted for 96% of all exports and 30% of Nigeria´s GDP in 1980. 
“Dutch Disease” is a term that perfectly describes this form of inorganic increase in government revenue. This mostly happens when a country has a predominant economic sector that experiences an explosive growth because of an increase in global demand. This economic model was first described in the weekly newspaper The Economist in 1977. It analysed how the discovery of 2.8trn cubic meters of natural gas in the Netherlands overvalued the Dutch currency and thereby harmed the Dutch economy (The Economist, 2014).
Because of the economic growth correlated to the oil, the Nigerian government stopped investments in the agricultural sector, which employed more than 60% of Nigeria´s total labour force in order to allocate more jobs into the high paying oil sector. With this reform of the economy came Nigeria´s dependency on the export of crude oil and its volatility on the unpredictable price of oil.

# 2.2 The negative effects of the “Dutch Disease”
As Zuzana Brinčíková states in her article “The Dutch Disease: An Overview”, published in 2016 by the European Scientific Journal, the effects of the “Dutch-Disease” differ relative to the exchange rate mechanism of a country. The rate of exchange Nigeria used until 1986 was a fixed one, meaning that the Nigerian Naira was based on the international price of gold. This meant that with a rise in the price of gold came an upswing in the value of the Nigerian currency and vice-versa. Brinčíková writes that in fixed exchange systems “large inflows of foreign currency will increase the money supply and domestic prices” (Brinčíková 2016, p.3). This results in an economic domino effect, causing the traditional exports to become more and more expensive for other countries to buy because of the higher monetary supply. Another effect of the Dutch Disease is the reduction of influence of other economic sectors. This happens because foreign produced goods remain at a low price while products that were manufactured in the “infected country” become more expensive to pay for the higher wages. This gives imported products an advantage over home-made ones, causing the other sectors of its own economy as well as competition in the countries home market to cripple (Anjande 2017, p.3). In 1975 Nigeria´s secondary sector was only responsible for 10.4% of its annual GDP, whereas its primary sector, that includes the extraction of raw materials made up 68.9% of Nigeria´s GDP. The dependency on the oil sector that comes with the decline of alternative forms of revenue caused the Nigerian government to spiral out of control trying to generate revenue to build infrastructure and other long-term investments by locating more workforce to foreign oil companies like Shell, which in return only made the country more dependent on petroleum exports and the interest of oil companies.  

# 2.3 How does Namibia´s economy compare to Nigeria?
Nigeria is Africa´s biggest economy with an annual GDP of 448.1 billion USD, being more than 30 times larger than Namibia´s 12.37 billion USD in GDP (World Bank Data). As stated, Nigeria still has a very oil dominated stream of revenue, meaning that with a drop in oil prices comes a nationwide recession because one tenth of Nigeria´s national income comes from the export of crude oil (World Bank Data). An example for this causation is the countries recession between 2014 and 2016 as a result of a global drop in oil prices due to “booming U.S. oil production, receding geopolitical concerns, and shifting OPEC policies” (Stocker 2018). Namibia on the other hand is the fourth-largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa.” (Namibia Country mining guide 2014, p.4). The mining sector has about the same participance in its GDP than the oil sector has in Nigeria with 11.6% of its annual created value coming from the extraction of uranium, diamonds, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and magnesium (see: Namibia Country mining guide 2014, p.4). However, most of the revenue comes from the cut and export of diamonds. 
Although not as strong as in Nigeria, a small correlation between the price of diamonds and national GDP occurred in 2012. An example for this behaviour is the drop in diamond prices between the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2013 . In this timeframe the average retail price for diamonds dropped by 10.2%, from 234 USD per carat to 210 USD per carat (DPI). As a reaction to this the Namibian GDP also dropped by 8% in the same timeframe. But this connection between diamond price and GDP is only a correlation because, unlike in Nigeria´s oil-related recession, the global economic downturn in 2011 makes it highly plausible that both diamond prices and national GDP are not linked to one another but both variables are connected to the economic downturn in 2011.   
So why doesn’t Namibia suffer from the same consequences of the Dutch Disease as Nigeria does if it is so reliant on the manufacturing of diamonds? Namibia is part of the 2002 Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Agreement that allows it under article 26 the “Protection of Infant Industries”. This agreement between Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Namibia was adopted to strengthen competition in their home markets by protecting their markets from cheap imports harming their economy (SACU article 26). This was agreed upon to combat the symptoms of the Dutch Disease as mentioned on page 3. Despite diamonds making up 39% of total exports and an average of 14,5% of the nominal GDP since its independence (International Monetary Fund 2008), Namibia avoided the negative effects of the Dutch Disease. Because even though Namibia´s economy is mostly reliant on the collected taxes from the diamond sector “effective investments and sound institutional quality.” (Malmström 2009, p.2) helped to minimize the economic dependency on the export of cut and raw diamonds.      

# 2.4 The Kavango Region: An Overview
The Kavango Region (Kavango East & Kavango West) is one of Namibia´s poorest Regions, struggling with “inadequate water infrastructure and poor rural electrification infrastructure” (Muyamba 2020). This map by the National Planning Commission Namibia shows that more than 50% of the 220,000 (2011) Namibians, living in the Kavango region live below the national poverty line. The Kavango region also has Namibia´s 3rd highest unemployment rate with 29,8% of the population being unemployed (Duddy, 2013). Because of the high rates in poverty and unemployment many people, living in the split Kavango regions are moving to the northern, Angolan side of the Okavango river (Mendelsohn 2009, p.5). The Kavango area is also located at an elevation of 1100m above sea level and has a much higher rainfall than southern parts of Namibia, allowing the inhabitants to farm crops on its fertile soil. 
Conservationists are concerned that the drilling for natural oil and gas sources could have a devastating impact on the Okavango river basin, which connects the potential oil drilling sites to the Okavango Dela in north-western Botswana. 

# 2.5 What Plan does Recon Africa Have?
In its most recent image video (see Appendix, p.II), Jay Park, chairmen of ReconAfrica proudly announces the discovery of up to 120 billion barrels of natural oil in north-eastern Namibia and north-western Botswana and that ReconAfrica acquired 90% of the rights for oil drillings in 6.3 million acres in Namibia and 100% of the rights for 2.45 million acres in Botswana. In comparison, Nigeria only has a third of the in Namibia expected oil reserves left. Then a quote from Bill Cathey is shown that reads “Nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial hydrocarbons ” 
This is a huge potential for the junior oil company from Canada and their Shareholders to profit from the massive amounts of oil, that are currently lying underneath the rivers, forests, and plantations of the Kavango region. Regarding the environmental concerns, by the local farmers about groundwater pollution ReconAfrica only indicated that they are following all environmental regulations. But Adolf Muremi, a chairperson of the farmers union still thinks that the local farmers around the drilling sites should be informed about the execution of the project and that they are not against the development that comes with the extraction of oil near their village but that “it should not be on the expenses of the people”, as he then warns about oil related diseases (see: Appendix, p.I). 

# 2.6 How Would the Export of Oil Change the Namibian Politics and Economy? 
It is safe to say that the discovery of oil in Namibia comes with both good and bad effects on the country. Since Namibia already has mining as their primary source of revenue it is safe to say that the addition of a powerful and transparent oil sector would make the economy more diverse, not less (see: Polus 2015). Also, Namibia is still part of the South African Custom Union allowing it to protect its home markets against the symptoms that come with a mono-economy. While it probably will not be possible to eliminate all negative effects of the Dutch Disease, the regulation policies in the SACU agreement will at least protect the competitiveness in the Namibian market. Another advantage the extraction of oil in Namibia has, compared to Nigeria is that Namibia is part of a monetary union together with South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini. This means that the Namibian currency is partly backed up by the South African rand. Because of this the Namibian economy should be ready for the ongoing challenges of keeping the oil sector at a non-destructive level. Another challenge that will come with the petroleum industry is keeping the political influence of ReconAfrica as close to zero as possible. Although ReconAfrica has approved an anti-bribery policy in 2018 it is questionable that it will stand the test of time because Shell also has a very strict anti-bribery policy but still paid 1.3 billion USD to Malabu Oil and Gas, disguised as payment to the Nigerian government (see: Taylor, 2019). This does not 
mean that Namibia will be brought into a new colonial era, but that Namibia will actively have to fight against corruption to remain at a Corruption perception index score that is more than double Nigeria´s score. 

# 2.7 What Effects Would Oil Drillings Have on the Kavango Region?
ReconAfrica regularly praise themselves and their altruistic behaviour in their new web journal “The Voices of Kavango”. When they built portable water wells, they uploaded quotes like “I am singing praises to God and to your company [ReconAfrica], this is the first time I have clean tap-water a stone’s throw away, since settling here in 1979” (The Voices of Kavango). 
But how does ReconAfrica deal with the concerns of environmentalists? In their six pages long web journal ReconAfrica dedicates four rows of text to the concerns of environmentalist and people living near the oil field, saying they have “no scientific evidence, to paint the project as a danger to the environment,” (p.3). This is not the first time ReconAfrica didn´t take concerns about their plan seriously, once calling warnings about the impact of the oil drillings “utter blindly stupidity and nonsense of the highest level” (Shikongo 2021). But how are they planning on keeping the concerns a nonsense? 
Scot Evans, CEO of ReconAfrica writes that they are “committed to a responsible approach to [their] project activities and [their] overall business” and that the company also “has taken many steps to ensure [their] approach to business is sustainable with positive outcomes for all [of the companies] stakeholders”. (website) This false promise of labelling products as unharmful for the environment is called “Greenwashing” and is done by companies to appeal more to the growing demand for “green” products (Kenton, 2021). Another example for this behaviour is Shell´s effort to appear as an environmentally friendly company by investing 300 million USD in natural ecosystems which sounds like a great effort “until you compare it with Shell’s annual income of $24bn” (Monbiot, 2019). The same thing applies for ReconAfrica praising their environmental efforts on their website while threatening lawsuits against critical press like The Namibian and National Geographic (Musheko 2021). 
It is safe to assume that the drilling for natural underground resources is directly connected to environmental damage in some form (The Wilderness Society 2019). But even if there was a way to extract natural oil without harming any of the participating parties, oil is still a fossil fuel that heavily contributes to climate change when burned. In a world that is trying to move away from fossil fuel, beginning a new operation to extract more of that may bring new economic possibilities and improve the country’s infrastructure but may cost us the habitability of our planet. 

# 3. Conclusion
One thing that is safe to say about ReconAfrica is that they are not fully transparent when it comes to their impact on the Kavango Region because of the one-sided coverage of the topic and the filing of lawsuits against critical newspapers.
Since all three test drillings in the Kavango Delta were very successful, ReconAfrica is probably not planning on stopping their projects which means that the Namibian government will have to put up a great effort to keep the oil sector from corrupting the economy like it has done in Nigeria.
